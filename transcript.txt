Hello, I want to reconcile some data.

Hello! I'd be happy to help you reconcile your data. Let me first check what data sources you have available.
Great! I can see you have 4 data sources available:

**Database sources:**
- **invoices** - PostgreSQL table with invoices
- **payments** - PostgreSQL table with payments  

**CSV file sources:**
- **invoices_csv** - CSV file with invoices
- **payments_csv** - CSV file with payments

All sources are connected and ready to use. What would you like to reconcile? For example:
- Match invoices to payments to find which invoices have been paid?
- Compare the database tables with the CSV files?
- Something else?

Let me know which sources you'd like to work with!

Perfect! Let's reconcile the invoices CSV and payments CSV files. First, let me take a look at the structure of both sources to understand what data we're working with.
It looks like there might be an issue accessing the CSV files. Let me check what sources are actually available:
The CSV files are connected, but there seems to be an access issue. Let me try to get previews of the available database sources instead, which can give us the same information:
I'm having trouble accessing the data sources to show you their structure. This might be a temporary connectivity issue. 

However, I can still help you get started! To proceed with the reconciliation, I need to understand what kind of data filtering you'd like to do to create workable samples. For example:

- Do you want to focus on invoices from a specific date range?
- Are you looking at invoices for particular customers or amounts?
- Any specific criteria for the payments (date range, amount range, etc.)?

This will help me load appropriate samples once the connectivity issue is resolved. What filtering criteria would make sense for your reconciliation?
