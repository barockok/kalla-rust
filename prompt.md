I am building an Open-Source Universal Reconciliation Engine (URE) designed for finance teams to reconcile TB-scale data using Natural Language. The architecture uses Apache Arrow DataFusion as the compute engine in a 'Neutral Zone' to allow federated joins across Postgres, S3, and BigQuery.Please generate a detailed, phase-by-phase engineering roadmap to build the MVP. Structure the response into the following 4 milestones:Phase 1: The Foundation (Core Compute)Design a Rust-based CLI that uses DataFusion to perform a Hash Join between a local CSV and a remote Postgres table.Implement a custom UDF for 'Financial Tolerance' (e.g., matching amounts within a $\pm 0.01$ range).Phase 2: The Logic Bridge (Match Recipe IR)Define a formal JSON schema for the 'Match Recipe' that covers 1:1, 1:N, and M:1 patterns.Write a Python-based 'Transpiler' that converts this JSON into DataFusion Logical Plans.Phase 3: AI Orchestration (NL-to-Recipe)Design the prompt engineering strategy to feed table schemas (metadata) to an LLM to generate the Match Recipe.Implement a 'Safety Guardrail' that ensures the LLM never sees PII, only schema headers and data types.Phase 4: The Evidence Store & ReportingDesign the schema for an 'Evidence Store' using Parquet files that logs match confidence and rule triggers.Create the 'Non-Recon' output logic that identifies orphaned records and exports them for human review.For each phase, identify potential performance bottlenecks and suggest specific Rust crates or Python libraries to use.
