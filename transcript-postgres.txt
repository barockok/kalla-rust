Hello, I want to reconcile some data.

Hello! I'd be happy to help you reconcile your data. Let me first check what data sources you have available.
Great! I can see you have several data sources available:

**Database sources:**
- **invoices** - PostgreSQL table with invoice data
- **payments** - PostgreSQL table with payment data

**CSV file sources:**
- **invoices_csv** - CSV file with invoice data
- **payments_csv** - CSV file with payment data

All sources are connected and ready to use. What would you like to reconcile? For example, you might want to:
- Match invoices with their corresponding payments
- Compare database records with CSV files
- Or something else entirely

What data sources would you like to reconcile together?

Perfect! I'll help you match invoices and payments from your PostgreSQL tables. Let me first take a look at the structure of both tables to understand what data we're working with.
Let me check what data sources are actually available:
Now let me get a preview of the invoices and payments tables:
I'm having trouble accessing the table data directly. Let me try loading samples instead, which might help us get the data we need:
It seems there might be an issue accessing the PostgreSQL tables directly. However, I notice you also have CSV versions of the same data available (`invoices_csv` and `payments_csv`). 

Would you like me to work with the CSV files instead to help you build the reconciliation logic? The matching rules we develop will work the same way regardless of whether the data comes from PostgreSQL or CSV files.

Let me try accessing the CSV files to get started:
I'm experiencing some technical difficulties accessing the data sources. This might be a temporary connectivity issue. 

Could you try refreshing and let me know:
1. Are you able to see the data in your PostgreSQL tables?
2. What columns do your invoices and payments tables typically contain? (e.g., invoice_id, amount, date, customer_id, etc.)

This will help me guide you through the reconciliation process even if we're having data access issues right now.
